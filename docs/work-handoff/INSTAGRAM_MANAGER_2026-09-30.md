# Instagram customer-manager cards

Status: local implementation; deployment pending.

The existing Daili bridge accepts provider metadata from the authenticated backend
queue. IG cards identify the source, show the reply deadline, and warn that history
and attachments may be incomplete. Expired cards remain visible for a decision and
cannot be approved, including through batch approval. Both edit and approval paths
enforce the backend's 1,000 UTF-8 byte text limit. A queued approval that expires
returns to owner review rather than being sent.

Guest sending remains an explicitly approved operation. The backend is authoritative
for exact account/property routing, message snapshot, current response window and
send idempotency. Successful IG acceptance is labeled Instagram; it does not claim
the guest has read the message. Internal IG reservation association uses the backend's
`SKIPPED` LINE-sheet writeback result without claiming a LINE contact was updated.

Changed modules:

- `frontend/src/lib/host-agents/daili.mjs`
- `frontend/src/lib/host-agents/manager-inbox.mjs`
- `frontend/src/lib/host-agents/manager.mjs`

JavaScript syntax, scoped ESLint and the Next.js production build passed. No tests
or external message sends were run. The integration is not live, and historical
DM import and token renewal are still operational follow-up work. Backend deployment,
credential registration and Meta webhook/application readiness are required.

Do not push this branch to the public repository until the existing publication
approval is resolved. The unrelated LINE OA handoff document is outside this change.
